### SK8 via ST Nucleo-L031K6

This was a collab project where me and my friend used this microprocessor to make a game. We connected the processor to a LCD screen, buttons and LEDs
The game is about a skateboard that has 3 lives and has to jump over incoming objects. The objects are randomly picked and then spawn and move towards
the skateboard. The user then has to press the up button to jump over the objects. If a collision is detected then one of the LEDs is turned off. This
is repeated until all 3 are off. The users score is then displayed and the user is prompted with a play again object.
